# 💸 Earn Yield by Destroying FLUX, ArbiFLUX & LOCK Tokens

This guide explains how to leverage the secondary function of your FLUX, ArbiFLUX, and LOCK tokens: destroying them to generate a higher yield. By doing so, you increase your yield multiplier, which can significantly boost your yield generation rate (up to 10x faster). The amount of tokens required to achieve these multipliers is displayed on your dashboard.

Both generating yield and destroying tokens for higher yield are smart contract actions that incur a small gas fee. If your wallet holds FLUX, ArbiFLUX, or LOCK tokens, the "DESTROY" button will be active. When confirming your transaction in MetaMask, we recommend setting the gas fee to "Fast" for quicker processing.

## Destroying LOCK Tokens for Yield

Destroying LOCK tokens has a unique effect: it redirects value to the permanent liquidity pool, strengthening the ecosystem's foundation rather than simply decreasing the token supply. This creates a more stable and resilient market for yield.

**Congratulations! You have successfully increased your yield multiplier.**

**Important:** The amount of tokens you destroy is **PERMANENT** and the resulting yield increase is forever associated with your Ethereum address. Stopping your validator will not reset your yield multiplier.
